    title: 'Early Fascination with Technology',
    description: 'Since my childhood I had a keen interest in computers and technology. I learned to use computers when I was in 1st standard. My uncle had a xerox photocopy shop and after school I often spent my time learning computer skills and doing simple tasks like downloading and printing, nothing more fancy. When a teacher asked in GK class what I wanted to become, I used to say "I want to become a software engineer," even though I didn\'t know the definition of a software engineer and had just heard the term from my friend. Alhamdulillah, today that dream has become reality. Everytime I think about this, I feel so blessed and it gives me energy.',

    description: 'I started my internet journey in 2014 and created my first Facebook account with help from my friend Aftab Chand. After using Facebook for some time, I started understanding how Google, Facebook, and other websites worked. I wondered if I could build a custom website for myself, just to show off. I wasn\'t good in English, so when I searched on Google about how to create a website, the articles were only available in English and I had neither technical knowledge nor English skills to understand them. I created a blogspot website on Blogger (Google\'s platform) and started posting random general knowledge content. Fortunately, I was studying in an English-medium school, so over time I was able to understand English better. By reading articles, I managed to build my first website on May 16, 2016. I launched blogginghindi.com which was built on WordPress and I started writing articles to earn money from the internet.',

    description: 'After working consistently for 2 years and writing more than 300 articles on my website, I received my first payment in 2018. I was very happy because this was my life\'s first earning, around $100+. At the same time, other people who were doing full-time blogging were earning more than 2 lakh rupees monthly. But since I was studying, I couldn\'t do full-time blogging. I didn\'t want to give up on education at such an early age. I attended a Google Search Conference hosted by Google, which was a magical moment for me. I had always dreamed of working with Google, and somehow I was able to contribute to Google, which is why we received an invitation. My friend Aftab Chand and I went to Patna. This was the first time I left my city. I was doing all these things out of curiosity; otherwise, I wouldn\'t even have fit in with the group of older people‚ÄîI was the youngest one there.',

    title: 'First Laptop & Server Management',
    description: 'I passed my 10th examination and purchased my first laptop, proudly using my own earned money. That same year, I got the highest traffic on my website. In a single day, I generated $348 (around 20,000+ INR), but my website server went down because of the high traffic. Since my 10th exam was about to be held, I had to give up my phone and everything for 2 months. I couldn\'t migrate the server, so the website\'s traffic declined (because Google doesn\'t rank unavailable websites). It was a golden opportunity‚Äîif I had been able to capitalize on it, I could easily have made 10 lakh rupees monthly from that traffic. Other bloggers (from Odisha and other states) grabbed similar opportunities and made more than 10 lakh rupees per month at that time. I missed this opportunity because I had no laptop, and managing a website from a mobile phone was impossible. Later, I migrated my website to Digital Ocean servers to handle millions of visitors simultaneously.',

    title: 'Pandemic Opportunity',
    description: 'In 2020, when lockdown occurred, I was preparing for the JEE Mains examination. My coaching center was closed with no classes running. I decided to create a new website focusing on government schemes. The government was launching many new schemes (like sending money to people\'s accounts), and people were searching for information on Google. So I created a website where I wrote about these government schemes. After consistent day and night work, the website became successful with more than 100K daily visitors. I earned between 70K to 150K+ rupees monthly. Some others were able to generate more than 20 lakh rupees monthly on similar topics.',

    description: 'Since I was generating a good amount of money, I got a great idea and decided to start working on it. I formed a small team and began developing my startup idea. The concept was to build an EdTech startup for all state board students in India. Every state has its own education board like Bihar Board, UP Board, etc. My idea was to provide study materials for students from all these different boards. My team and I started working on this idea from my home. We worked 15+ hours daily to achieve our target. I passed my 12th exam in 2021, but took a 1-year break for JEE preparation and to work on this idea.',

My team was small and the idea was very big‚Äîeven giants like Byju\'s aren\'t able to work on such a broad scope. The startup failed, and I had invested more than 5 lakh rupees in this idea. My government scheme website\'s traffic was also declining, and my earnings were decreasing month by month. I decided to pursue education because I knew learning new skills would be best; I could earn a good amount now, but that might not be sustainable in the future. So I took admission at Lovely Professional University. In my first year, I spent too much time and energy on unnecessary things. But everything happens for a reason. Maybe Allah wanted to test me, so He put me through difficulties. Nevertheless, we should learn from our mistakes‚Äîeverything is written.',

You have to learn new programming languages and tackle new concepts. Since I had good experience with technologies and knew programming languages like PHP, JavaScript (a little), HTML, CSS, etc., I was good at programming. However, I struggled with soft skills and couldn\'t speak confidently in front of people. I also performed only at an average level in theoretical subjects.',
